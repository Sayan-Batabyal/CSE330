// Minimum steps to reach a destination
// Given a number line from -infinity to +infinity. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in iâ€™th move, you take i steps. 

// Find if you can reach a given number x 
// Find the most optimal way to reach a given number x, if we can indeed reach it. For example, 3 can be reached in 2 steps, (0, 1) (1, 3) and 4 can be reached in 3 steps (0, -1), (-1, 1) (1, 4)
